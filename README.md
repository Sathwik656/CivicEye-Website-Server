## 🚀 Running Locally

### Prerequisites
You need a local web server with PHP support (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP, WAMP, Laragon, or PHP's built-in server).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHADOW2669/CivicEye-Website-Server.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**
   ```bash
   cd CivicEye-Website-Server
   ```

3. **Place in your server directory**  
   Move or copy the folder into your server’s document root:
   - XAMPP/MAMP: `htdocs`
   - WAMP: `www`

4. **Start your server**  
   Ensure Apache/Nginx and PHP are running.

5. **Access via browser**  
   Navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost/CivicEye-Website-Server/
   ```
   Or specific pages like:
   ```
   http://localhost/CivicEye-Website-Server/login.php
   http://localhost/CivicEye-Website-Server/download.php
   ```

> ⚠️ Note: Do not open `.php` files directly in the browser file system (e.g., `file://`), as PHP needs a server to execute.
